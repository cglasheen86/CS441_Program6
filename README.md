Rate My Cat!
Mysql database and php experimentation

My app showcases a user account capability for android apps. Users can create their account through the app, and their information is saved to my database. A php script checks to make sure that everything checks out, like if the password field matches the confirm password field, and if an account already exists with the entered email address.

After the account is created, you are greeted by name and are shown a picture of my cat Penny. I wanted to allow the user to rate my cat by clicking the yes or no button. This button would alter the user's row in my database to reflect that they voted positively or negativly. After that, the results of every row would be tallied up and presented to the user. Unfortunately I didn't get to finish implementing this, however I imagine it's really not that hard even though I havn't found the correct way to do this yet.
